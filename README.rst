 lexlib
========

    Python package containing functions that may be useful for word research.

.. note:: This project is a work in progress. New functions may be added at
   any point. I will use `semantic versioning <https://semver.org>`_ to make
   the impact of any changes to the package clear.

------------------
 Package Contents
------------------

* **clusters**: Extract consonant clusters from a list of words.
* **neighbors**: Find the phonological neighbors of a list of words using the
  one-phoneme deletion, addition, or substitution rule (Luce & Pisoni, 1998).
* **syllable_filter**: Extract words with the desired number of syllables
  from a list.
* **words_only**: Retrieve only the column of interest from a data frame-like 
  corpus. Specifically intended for extracting words, but has flexibility.
