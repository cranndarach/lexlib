    Iterates through the word list, comparing each word in the
    corpus to the current word in length, and passing it to the
    appropriate "checker" function, or moving on if its length
    indicates that it is not a neighbor. If the checker returns
    True, then it appends that word to the current word's "neighbor"
    entry.

    keyword arguments:
        words -- Path to the file containing the words whose
        neighbors will be found. Should contain forms only, one per line.
        corpus -- Path to the file containing the corpus. Forms only,
        one per line.
        sep -- String used to separate phonemes in the phonological forms.
        To separate into individual characters, set to None (default).
        debug -- If True, it logs the current word and the words being
        compared to it to the console. Defaults to False.
